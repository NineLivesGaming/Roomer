# Roomer
Repository for the WiP game Roomer

Going to attempt to follow this model for hte development: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
Created the develop branch, will try to work from there.0
Going to work on setting up unity with Git so that we can work on stuff.

Would also like to create a page of somekind for the website (ninelivesgaming). Just like a "under construction" or something so that there is actually something there.
